This version has been in the collection of the Museo del Prado in Madrid since 1819 and was long considered an unremarkable copy. However, following its restoration in 2012, the Prado Mona Lisa has been recognised as the earliest known studio copy of Leonardo's original, with significant historical and artistic value.</p>","tags":["Renaissance_Art","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Museum_Collections"]},{"location":"Art/The%20Prado%20Mona%20Lisa/#origins-and-historical-context","title":"Origins and Historical Context","text":"<p>The origins of the Prado Mona Lisa are closely linked to those of Leonardo's original painting, as both were likely created simultaneously in the same workshop. It is believed that the Prado version may have been painted by one of Leonardo\u2019s students, possibly Francesco Melzi or Sala\u00ec, though some scholars suggest it could have been produced by a Spanish student such as Fernando Y\u00e1\u00f1ez de la Almedina or Hernando de los Llanos.</p> <p>The first documentary reference to the painting appeared in a 1666 inventory of the Galleria del Mediodia in Madrid\u2019s Alc\u00e1zar, where it was described as a work \"by the hand of [[Leonardo da Vinci]].\" While the exact date of its arrival in Spain remains uncertain, it is speculated that the painting entered the Spanish Royal Collection in the early 17th century. Since the Prado Museum\u2019s founding in 1819, the copy has been part of its permanent collection.</p>","tags":["Renaissance_Art","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Museum_Collections"]},{"location":"Art/The%20Prado%20Mona%20Lisa/#restoration-and-discoveries","title":"Restoration and Discoveries","text":"<p>Before its restoration, the Prado Mona Lisa was obscured by a thick layer of darkened varnish and black overpainting, which concealed its original landscape background. It was classified as an anonymous copy from the early 16th century and was often displayed alongside Italian masterpieces, despite being considered of secondary importance. However, a lithograph reproduction of the painting suggested that it was held in some regard even before its true origins were uncovered.</p> <p>Between 2011 and 2012, the Prado Museum conducted an extensive restoration of the painting, prompted by a request to include it in the Louvre's exhibition Leonardo's Last Masterpiece: The Sainte Anne. During this process, conservators removed the black repaint, revealing a landscape background similar to that in the Louvre\u2019s Mona Lisa. Scientific analyses, including infrared reflectography and radiography, confirmed that the painting was produced in Leonardo\u2019s workshop, showing an underlying drawing with corrections indicative of a direct connection to the master\u2019s work.</p>","tags":["Renaissance_Art","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Museum_Collections"]},{"location":"Art/The%20Prado%20Mona%20Lisa/#artistic-and-technical-significance","title":"Artistic and Technical Significance","text":"<p>The Prado Mona Lisa is notable for its strikingly well-preserved colours, which provide insight into how the original Mona Lisa may have looked before centuries of varnish darkened its surface. The painting's crisp detail and vibrant hues contrast with the more muted appearance of Leonardo's version due to ageing and conservation challenges.</p> <p>One intriguing hypothesis proposed after the restoration was that the Prado Mona Lisa and the Louvre Mona Lisa were painted from slightly different perspectives, potentially forming one of the earliest stereoscopic images. If viewed dichoptically\u2014where one eye sees the Prado version and the other sees the Louvre version\u2014the pair might create a three-dimensional effect. Leonardo had explored the concept of stereoscopic vision in his Trattato della Pittura, making this theory plausible. However, subsequent studies have found no reliable evidence that the two paintings function as a true stereoscopic pair.</p>","tags":["Renaissance_Art","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Museum_Collections"]},{"location":"Art/The%20Prado%20Mona%20Lisa/#attribution-and-artistic-execution","title":"Attribution and Artistic Execution","text":"<p>Prior to restoration, the painting was sometimes attributed to the Flemish school, based on the mistaken belief that its wooden panel was made of oak. However, conservation analysis revealed that the panel is walnut, a material commonly used in Leonardo\u2019s works such as Lady with an Ermine and Saint John the Baptist. This discovery strengthened the case for its creation within Leonardo's workshop.</p> <p>The meticulous execution of the Prado Mona Lisa, including the use of high-quality materials such as lapis lazuli and red lacquer, sets it apart from typical workshop copies. This level of precision suggests it was not merely a reproduction but an important parallel work created under Leonardo\u2019s direct supervision. Art historian Ana Gonz\u00e1les Mozo has also noted stylistic similarities between the Prado Mona Lisa and the so-called Ganay copy of Salvator Mundi, suggesting they may have been painted by the same hand.</p>","tags":["Renaissance_Art","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Museum_Collections"]},{"location":"Art/The%20Prado%20Mona%20Lisa/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>The Prado Mona Lisa stands as a crucial piece in the study of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s artistic practice. Its restoration has shed light on the methods used in Leonardo\u2019s workshop and offered valuable clues about the original Mona Lisa\u2019s appearance.
