# The Prado Mona Lisa

The Prado Mona Lisa is a painting attributed to the workshop of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], depicting the same subject and composition as Leonardo's renowned Mona Lisa housed in the Louvre, Paris. This version has been in the collection of the Museo del Prado in Madrid since 1819 and was long considered an unremarkable copy. However, following its restoration in 2012, the Prado Mona Lisa has been recognised as the earliest known studio copy of Leonardo's original, with significant historical and artistic value.

## Origins and Historical Context

The origins of the Prado Mona Lisa are closely linked to those of Leonardo's original painting, as both were likely created simultaneously in the same workshop. It is believed that the Prado version may have been painted by one of Leonardo’s students, possibly Francesco Melzi or Salaì, though some scholars suggest it could have been produced by a Spanish student such as Fernando Yáñez de la Almedina or Hernando de los Llanos.

The first documentary reference to the painting appeared in a 1666 inventory of the Galleria del Mediodia in Madrid’s Alcázar, where it was described as a work "by the hand of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]." While the exact date of its arrival in Spain remains uncertain, it is speculated that the painting entered the Spanish Royal Collection in the early 17th century. Since the Prado Museum’s founding in 1819, the copy has been part of its permanent collection.

## Restoration and Discoveries

Before its restoration, the Prado Mona Lisa was obscured by a thick layer of darkened varnish and black overpainting, which concealed its original landscape background. It was classified as an anonymous copy from the early 16th century and was often displayed alongside Italian masterpieces, despite being considered of secondary importance. However, a lithograph reproduction of the painting suggested that it was held in some regard even before its true origins were uncovered.

Between 2011 and 2012, the Prado Museum conducted an extensive restoration of the painting, prompted by a request to include it in the Louvre's exhibition _Leonardo's Last Masterpiece: The Sainte Anne_. During this process, conservators removed the black repaint, revealing a landscape background similar to that in the Louvre’s Mona Lisa. Scientific analyses, including infrared reflectography and radiography, confirmed that the painting was produced in Leonardo’s workshop, showing an underlying drawing with corrections indicative of a direct connection to the master’s work.

## Artistic and Technical Significance

The Prado Mona Lisa is notable for its strikingly well-preserved colours, which provide insight into how the original Mona Lisa may have looked before centuries of varnish darkened its surface. The painting's crisp detail and vibrant hues contrast with the more muted appearance of Leonardo's version due to ageing and conservation challenges.

One intriguing hypothesis proposed after the restoration was that the Prado Mona Lisa and the Louvre Mona Lisa were painted from slightly different perspectives, potentially forming one of the earliest stereoscopic images. If viewed dichoptically—where one eye sees the Prado version and the other sees the Louvre version—the pair might create a three-dimensional effect. Leonardo had explored the concept of stereoscopic vision in his _Trattato della Pittura_, making this theory plausible. However, subsequent studies have found no reliable evidence that the two paintings function as a true stereoscopic pair.

## Attribution and Artistic Execution

Prior to restoration, the painting was sometimes attributed to the Flemish school, based on the mistaken belief that its wooden panel was made of oak. However, conservation analysis revealed that the panel is walnut, a material commonly used in Leonardo’s works such as _Lady with an Ermine_ and _Saint John the Baptist_. This discovery strengthened the case for its creation within Leonardo's workshop.

The meticulous execution of the Prado Mona Lisa, including the use of high-quality materials such as lapis lazuli and red lacquer, sets it apart from typical workshop copies. This level of precision suggests it was not merely a reproduction but an important parallel work created under Leonardo’s direct supervision. Art historian Ana Gonzáles Mozo has also noted stylistic similarities between the Prado Mona Lisa and the so-called Ganay copy of _Salvator Mundi_, suggesting they may have been painted by the same hand.

## Conclusion

The Prado Mona Lisa stands as a crucial piece in the study of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s artistic practice. Its restoration has shed light on the methods used in Leonardo’s workshop and offered valuable clues about the original Mona Lisa’s appearance. While debate over the painting’s authorship continues, it remains the most historically significant studio copy of Leonardo’s masterpiece, providing an unparalleled glimpse into the creative process behind one of the world's most famous paintings.
